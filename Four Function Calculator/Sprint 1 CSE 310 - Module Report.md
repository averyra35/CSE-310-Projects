# CSE 310 - Module Report

Name: Avery Anderson

## Part 1 - Module Planning

This section should be filled on the first Monday of the Sprint and submitted

### Section 1.1 - Module Selection

1. What Sprint is this for (1-5)? 1

2. Select the Module (with a single X) that you will do this Sprint:

|Module                   |Selected Module|
|-------------------------|---------------|
|Cloud Databases          |               |
|Data Analysis            |               |
|Game Framework           |               |
|GIS Mapping              |               |
|Mobile App               |               |
|Networking               |               |
|SQL Relational Databases |               |
|Web Apps                 |               |
|C++                      |        X      |
|Java                     |               |
|Kotlin                   |               |
|Erlang                   |               |
|TypeScript               |               |
|Rust                     |               |
|Choose Your Own Adventure|               |

3. Find the list of unique requirements for your selected module in the Module Summary in Canvas.  In some circumstances, you will need to modify the requirements based on the technology or language you selected.  For the Choose Your Own Adventure, you need to create your own requirements.  List the unique module requirements below:

Write one or more programs in C++ that demonstrates some of the following:

    Variables
    Expressions
    Conditionals
    Loops
    Functions
    Classes
    Data structure from STL (such as a vector, list, or map)

### Section 1.2 - Planning

During the Sprint, you will spend 4 hours in class meetings, 4 hours on your team project (2 of which during class), and 10 hours on your selected module.  Make a plan for your 10 hours by answering the questions below.  You should refer back to this plan and make adjustments during the Sprint.

1. What sources have you selected to learn the technical material?
> C++ Tutorialâ€”W3Schools 

2. What is your plan to practice the new material?  In other words, what is the order in which you plan to learn the material before working on your demonstration software?
> I am going to take the free tutorial to practice C++, I will spend a few days on the tutorial and then start to practice the langauge and create a program.

3. What demonstration software do you plan on submitting at the end of the Sprint (note that this can and may change)?
> I am going to make a Calculator App

4. Identify the days, times, and locations that you will work on the module. 
> I will be working on this module in between my two classes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

5. Identify both a technical risk and a behavioral risk that you antcipate may occur during this Sprint.  What is your mitgigation plan?
> I think that I will probably run into a couple of syntax errors while programming in C++ and possibly have a few problems in the execution of the code and print statements for the calculator.


## Part 2 - Time Log

This section should be filled out during the Sprint. 

Record all CSE 310 work that you do on your individual module or the team project.  Include time learning, practicing, developing, testing, and documenting.  Don't include time spent in the 4 class meetings (Planning, Stand-Up, Team Review, and Individual Review).  You will need to sum of these hours at the end of the Sprint. Note that the hours you report will affect your grades.

Note that `IM` stands for Individual Module and `TP` stands for Team Project.  

|Date      |Start Time|IM or TP|Description                                 |Hours:Minutes|
|----------|----------|--------|--------------------------------------------|-------------|
|4/30|2:10|TP|I worked on getting the API key from chatGPT for our project|1:30|
|4/30|3:40|IM|I planned out the calculator program|0:30|
|5/1|11:20|IM|I looked into how classes are setup in C++ using W3schools tutorial|1:15|
|5/2|11:20|IM|Looked into getting user input using W3schools tutorial|1:00|
|5/2|12:20|IM|setup the class and the .cpp file for being able to use the class members in the main function|2:00|
|5/4|3:25|IM|Troubleshooting with the classes and using the members in the other files|2:00|
|5/5|12:15|IM|Got the class working with using its members in the main function|1:45|
|5/6|11:20|IM|Implemented the menu for selecting the different functions|0:30|
|5/6|11:50|IM|Altered the menu order so that an absolute value function can be implemented|0:35|
|5/7|12:35|IM|Implemented the absolute value function and documented the Module Results section of this file|0:30|

_Note: Add more rows as needed._


## Part 3 - Module Results

This section should be filled out at the end of the Sprint and submitted.

1. Put your GitHub link for your demonstration software here: [Four Function Calculator(GitHub)](https://github.com/averyra35/CSE-310-Projects/tree/88b2e20ce519e0cd899bdd7c8043af742899d639/Four%20Function%20Calculator)

2. Put your YouTube link for your code walkthrough and demo video here: [Four Function Calculator(YouTube)](https://youtu.be/qR_75B30oRI)


3. Complete the following checklist by either indicating "Yes" or "No". If you indicate "No" then provide an explanation of why beneath the table.

|Question                                                    |Response|
|------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
|Are the links above public and working?                     |    Yes    |
|Did you complete all the unique requirements for the module?|    Yes    |
|Did you write at least 100 lines of code?                   |    Yes    |
|Did you fully complete the readme.md file?                  |    Yes    |
|Did you put the readme.md file in GitHub in the top folder? |    Yes    |

4. If you completed a Stretch Challenge (as shown in the Module Description document in Canvas) then describe what you did.  If you did the Choose Your Own Adventure module, then you get to decide what qualifies as a Stretch Challenge.
> I did not
5. Did you change your selected module during the middle of the Sprint?  If yes, then describe what you changed it to, when you changed it, and why you changed it.
> No
6. Using the log above, fill in the total hours and minutes you spent on the individual module:

|Activity         |Total Hours:Minutes|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|Individual Module|         10:05     |

7. What strategies (behavioral and technical) worked well during this Sprint?  What did not work well?  List some possible ways that you can improve next Sprint.
> Starting with planning and then the tutorials worked well, I did end up having to do more research halfway through when I was trying to troubleshoot the class and using its members. I think spending more time on the tutorials would help better.
