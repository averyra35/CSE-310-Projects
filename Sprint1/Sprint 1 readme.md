## Overview

**Project Title**: C++ Calculator

**Project Description**: A four function calculator built in C++ to help learn the syntax and language

**Project Goals**:Implement Addition, Implement Subtraction, Implement Multiplication, and then Implement Division

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Build the four functions for the program
2. define and code the four different functions
3. code the main system to ask for numbers and return the answers

Instructions for using the software:

1. input first number
2. select function
3. input second number
4. get the answer

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* <math.h>
* <cmath.>
